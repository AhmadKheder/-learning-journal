# Text Editor

A [text](https://ahmadkheder.github.io/-learning-journal/text)  editor is a computer program that lets a user enter, change, store,
and usually print text (characters and numbers, each encoded by the computer and
its input and output devices, arranged to have meaning to users
or to other programs). 
 Text editors can be used to enter program language source statements or to create documents such as technical manuals.
