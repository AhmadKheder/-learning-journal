# Git Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide

To start programminng using __Git__ we need to have a solid understanding of the [Command Line ](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)__cmd__ .

Then, 
Let's explore some of these abbreviation :
+ VCS
+ LVCS
+ CVCS
+ DVCS


### Local Version Control (LVCS):
Where programmers can work on the project that entails one DB on **the hard disk of their PCs** so,they can make changes on it.

Notis: * collaboration is hard enough*

### Centralized Version Control (CVCS):

This system entails a **single server** storing all changes and file versions, which **can be accessed by various clients**.
which eliminates the need to involve all ~~local databases~~ and allowe programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activitie


Notis: *the server as a single point *


### Distributed Version Control (DVCS):
A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVCS failure:

DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
