Let's talk a littel bit in those case's details

1. Challenges 
  You know that everyone face challenges in coding or math and you always get stuck in it
untile you conclude that it's impossble and you are incapable  of solving it, __STOP THINKING & ACTING LIKE A FIXED MINDSET__

All you have to do is to face the problem with a new strategy like, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When you are ready, walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until you start to see another way forward. I also recommend you to think out loud, that will lead you to find the root causes of your problem
