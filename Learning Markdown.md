Let's talk a littel bit in those case's details

1. Challenges 
  You know that everyone face challenges in coding or math and you always get stuck in it
untile you conclude that it's impossble and you are incapable  of solving it, __STOP THINKING & ACTING LIKE A FIXED MINDSET__

All you have to do is to face the problem with a new strategy like, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When you are ready, walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until you start to see another way forward. I also recommend you to think out loud, that will lead you to find the root causes of your problem.


2. Obstacles

A coworker talked about “instant gratification monkey syndrome.” It’s the idea that we’ll do just about anything other than the actual task at hand if it has suddenly become challenging, and especially when there are so many tempting diversions – articles, videos, email, social – mere clicks away.

You also get stuck in the phenomenon of knowing what needs to be done, but lacking the motivation to do it. His solution is to stand up, put down whatever project is sucking the gumption out of you, walk away, and return when you’re feeling more inspired.
Then you can keep going on with your project bit by bit until you get it done

3. Effort

The concept of “instant gratification monkey syndrome.” applies to procrastination in efforts you have to do, but you  feel better when you do it

here, you have to ask yourself 

   1. is this really what I want to do?
   1. Am I giving up too easily? 
   1. Would I rather shower off pangs of regret, or the sweat of accomplishment? .
